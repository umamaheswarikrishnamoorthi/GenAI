      <tr>
        <td>Clarity</td>
        <td>The story is somewhat technical and lacks a clear, concise description of the desired outcome. It appears to be a JSON object representing a response from a Jira API search query, but the purpose and expected result are not explicitly stated.</td>
        <td>12</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Completeness</td>
        <td>The story provides a detailed breakdown of the JSON object, including source, status code, response headers, and result. However, it lacks preconditions, acceptance criteria, and a clear description of the desired outcome.</td>
        <td>15</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Business Value Alignment</td>
        <td>The story does not explicitly align with tangible healthcare value, such as patient safety, compliance, or operational efficiency. While Jira API search queries may be relevant to healthcare projects, the story does not demonstrate a clear connection to healthcare-specific goals or objectives.</td>
        <td>10</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Testability</td>
        <td>The story provides a detailed technical specification, which can be used to derive test cases. However, the lack of clear acceptance criteria and preconditions makes it challenging to develop comprehensive test cases.</td>
        <td>14</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Technical Feasibility</td>
        <td>The story appears to be technically feasible, as it describes a JSON object representing a response from a Jira API search query. However, the story does not provide sufficient context to determine whether the desired outcome is achievable within typical healthcare system constraints.</td>
        <td>16</td>
